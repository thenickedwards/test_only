// UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

// Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// Sum to numbers

// What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// Two numbers (integers? floats? big numbers?)

// What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// Number (same as above)

// Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
// Ask interview if edge cases should be considered.

// How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
// function sumNumbers, num1, num2, total, etc.
